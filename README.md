The DEI Badging initiative is an award system whereby open-source events earn badges and enhance their events to be more inclusive using the feedback they get from reviewers. The DEI badges help nurture a system that promotes leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to building the Internet as a social good.

## Aim of the DEI Badging

- Establish an environment where events can engage in the badging program
- Aligning the badging program with best practices, guidelines, and recommendations from Diversity & Inclusion efforts on the CHAOSS project

- Building an open, peer-review system for the D&I Badging Program
