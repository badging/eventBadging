# Authoring Your Project's DEI.md File

1. When creating your own DEI.md file please use the this guide as well as the [Template.DEI.md](https://github.com/AllInOpenSource/ProjectBadging/blob/main/Template.DEI.md) file in your process.
2. If using a development platform, place the DEI.md file in a public, organizationally available repository, similar to your CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file
3. If an organizationally available folder is not available or used, place the DEI.md file in a public community repository
4. If you have a project website, provide a link to your DEI.md file from the main project navigation
5. The Sample DEI Project Statement indicates required statements (Required) and sample statements (Sample).

   - (**Required:Changes Needed**) indicates that the author provide information specific to their project.
   - (**Required:No Changes**) indicates that the statement should be included with no changes made.
   - (**Sample**) indicates that the statement contains information that may or may not be useful to the author. Sample statements can be modified and should only be included if they are applicable to your project.

6. If a statement is labeled (**Required:No Changes**), do not make any changes to the line. It is important to keep these statements as-is for badging purposes.
7. Your project must attend to all metrics described below and must include at least one described effort associated with each metric.
8. Do not use this file to create your DEI.md file. This file is only serves as a guide. Please download and use the [DEI.md Template](https://github.com/AllInOpenSource/ProjectBadging/blob/main/Template.DEI.md) when creating your own DEI.md file.
